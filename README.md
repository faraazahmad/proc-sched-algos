## How to compile
Run the following command
```
make build NAME=filename_without_extension
```

where `filename_without_extension` is the name of the
file without the `.cpp` extension.

for example:
```
make build NAME=sjf
```

## Run a compiled program
Similar to the compile command, run
```
make run NAME=filename_without_extension
```

## Delete all compiled binaries
```
make clean-all
```
